-- Description:
-- This mixin applies to both the NM: Big Bomb, as well as the Friar's Lantern bombs that
-- drop the smoke-filled flask.

-- Behavior:
-- These bombs will expand in size after taking a spike in damage of a recorded value exceeding 300. They evidently
-- increase in attack and magic power.
-- Note:
-- These values are a close approximation and are therefore ***experimental*** they require further captures and testing.
